# WordGame - iOS Coding Challenge for Babbel
[![Swift 5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5-green.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org/) [![Xcode 14.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-14.0.1-blue)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14_0_1-release-notes)

## Task Description
The task is to write a small language game. At the end of the challenge, a user will see an English word on the screen. While the English word is displayed, a word in Spanish will appear.
The user has to choose if the Spanish word is the correct or wrong translation for the displayed word.
The project is split into three milestones/deliverables.

## Dev Setup
`Clean, Build and Run! ðŸ˜Ž`

## Dev Notes ##
**App Architecture:** `Model View View Model` is used for the Architecture with some ideas from [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

**Technologies:** `Combine` and `SwiftUI` are used for handling the logic and the UI.

**Unit Testing:** `XCTest` is used for unit test.

**Dependency Manager:** `SPM` is used Handling dependencies, I used CombineSchedular dependency for handling Combine schedulars.

## TODO List:
- [x] Game Logic.
- [x] Rules.
- [X] End of the game.

## Time Spent
Arround 8 hours.

# Decision reasons
- Using MVVM for those reasonse:
  * **Better Separation of Concerns** The view model translates the data of the model layer into something the view layer can use. The controller is no longer responsible for this task.
  * **Improved Testability** View controllers are notoriously hard to test because of their relation to the view layer. By migrating data manipulation to the view model, testing becomes much easier.
  * **Transparent Communication** The responsibilities of the view controller are reduced to controlling the interaction between the view layer and the model layer, glueing both layers together. The view model provides a transparant interface to the view controller, which it uses to populate the view layer and interact with the model layer. This results in a transparant communication between the four layers of the application.
- Using **Inputs** and **Outputs** Interfaces in the game engine as it is a complex class, one interface we have too much details so I decided to make it easy to use the engine by introducing some inputs for the engine to work, and some outputs for the viewModels to use.
- Using **classes** in many places as I need those places to be refrence types as Score for example, as it will be easier for us to track the progress in any place by passing the object.
- Using **final** keyword in some Places as it will let the functions within it use the static method dispatch.
- Using **struct** in many places as structs have a clear and obvious reasons to use without worrying about the object state like using it in Rules. This is because structs are value types.
- Using **Abstraction** of the class and structs with `protocols` to make the code reusable. This will help as well in creation of better unit tests mocks.
- **Injecting** any object used in the constructors to create mocks for whatever we need.
- Using Concepts of **Solid Principles and OOP** for organising the code as using them will solve bad architecture problems like Fragility, Immobility and Rigidity.
